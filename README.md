# COMP-598-Final-Project

> Your team has been hired by a not-for-profit that wants to understand candidate discussion in the days following the US election. They have indicated that they are especially concerned with perceptions of election legitimacy. 
Specifically, they want to know:
> 1. The salient topics discussed around each candidate and what each topic primarily concerned
> 2. Relative engagement with those topics among liberals and conservatives

I've taken posts from the categories Hot, Top (past day), and Controversial (past day). See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1rqjwp/eli5_what_does_top_new_hot_controversial_old_mean/) for an explanation. We'll have to justify our design choices in the report, so we'll have to decide which category to use for our 2000 posts.

The files under `./data` without `filtered` in their filenames have 400 lines each; we can trim these to 333 manually.
